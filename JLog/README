This project is a seed for a complete logging system for Java applications
that gives similar functionality and ease of that found in the Android 
runtime logging facility "LogCat". An extension point planned is to provide
the ability to connect to remote clients to see the output of installed/
deployed applications for the purposes of remote debugging and technical 
support.
